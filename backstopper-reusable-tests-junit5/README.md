# Backstopper - reusable-tests

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 17 and greater.

(NOTE: The [Backstopper 1.x branch](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/backstopper/tree/v1.x) contains a version of
Backstopper for Java 7+, and for the `javax` ecosystem. The current Backstopper supports Java 17+ and the `jakarta`
ecosystem.)

This library contains some reusable unit test classes that should be integrated into every Backstopper-enabled
project to guarantee that the conventions and rules that Backstopper requires are followed. This is a fairly easy
process and is described in detail in the Backstopper User Guide in the [Reusable Unit Tests for Enforcing
Backstopper Rules and Conventions](../USER_GUIDE.md#reusable_tests) section.

Beyond that, the classes in this reusable-tests library are heavily documented with extensive javadocs, and the
[sample applications](../README.md#samples) show concrete usage of these tests to enforce the rules and conventions.
Please explore the source code and samples to learn more.
