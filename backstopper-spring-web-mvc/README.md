# Backstopper - spring-web-mvc

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 17 and greater.

(NOTE: The [Backstopper 1.x branch](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/backstopper/tree/v1.x) contains a version of
Backstopper for Java 7+, and for the `javax` ecosystem. The current Backstopper supports Java 17+ and the `jakarta`
ecosystem. The Backstopper 1.x releases also contain support for Spring 4 and 5, and Springboot 1 and 2.)

This readme focuses specifically on the Backstopper Spring Web MVC integration. If you are looking for a different
framework integration check out the [relevant section](../README.md#framework_modules) of the base readme to see if one
already exists. The [base project README.md](../README.md) and [User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md) contain the main bulk of
information regarding Backstopper.

**NOTE: There is a [Spring Web MVC sample application](../samples/sample-spring-web-mvc/) that provides a simple
concrete example of the information covered in this readme.**

## Backstopper Spring Web MVC Setup, Configuration, and Usage

### Spring / Spring Boot Versions

// TODO javax-to-jakarta: verify this statement about spring boot 3

This `backstopper-spring-web-mvc` library can be used in any Spring Web MVC `6.x.x` environment or later. This includes
Spring 6 and Spring Boot 3.

_NOTE: **This library does not cover Spring WebFlux (Netty) applications.** Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux are
[mutually exclusive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53883037/can-i-use-springmvc-and-webflux-together). If you're
looking for Backstopper support for Spring WebFlux please see the
[backstopper-spring-web-flux](../backstopper-spring-web-flux) module instead of this one._

### Setup

* Pull in the `com.nike.backstopper:backstopper-spring-web-mvc` dependency into your project.
* Register Backstopper components with Spring Web MVC, either via `@Import({BackstopperSpringWebMvcConfig.class})`, or
  `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.nike.backstopper")`. See the javadocs on `BackstopperSpringWebMvcConfig` for some
  related details.
    * This causes `SpringApiExceptionHandler` and `SpringUnhandledExceptionHandler` to be registered with the Spring
      Web MVC error handling chain in a way that overrides the default Spring Web MVC error handlers so that the
      Backstopper handlers will take care of *all* errors. It sets up `SpringApiExceptionHandler` with a default list
      of `ApiExceptionHandlerListener` listeners that should be sufficient for most projects. You can override that list
      of listeners (and/or many other Backstopper components) if needed in your project's Spring config.
    * It also registers `SpringContainerErrorController` to handle errors that happen outside Spring
      Web MVC (i.e. in the Servlet container), and make sure they're routed through Backstopper as well. Note that
      you'll need to configure your Servlet container to route container errors to the path this controller listens on
      (default `/error`) for it to work.
* Expose your project's `ProjectApiErrors` and a JSR 303 `jakarta.validation.Validator` implementation in your Spring
  dependency injection config.
    * `ProjectApiErrors` creation is discussed in the base Backstopper
      readme [here](../README.md#quickstart_usage_project_api_errors).
    * JSR 303 setup and generation of a `Validator` is discussed in the Backstopper User
      Guide [here](../USER_GUIDE.md#jsr_303_basic_setup). If you're not going to be doing any JSR 303 validation outside
      what is built-in supported by Spring Web MVC, *and* you don't want to bother jumping through the hoops to get a
      handle on Spring's JSR 303 validator impl provided by `WebMvcConfigurer.getValidator()`, *and* you don't want to
      bother creating a real `Validator` yourself then you can simply register `NoOpJsr303Validator#SINGLETON_IMPL` as
      the `Validator` that gets exposed by your Spring config. `ClientDataValidationService` and
      `FailFastServersideValidationService` would fail to do anything, but if you don't use those then it wouldn't
      matter.
* Setup the reusable unit tests for your project as described in the Backstopper User
  Guide [here](../USER_GUIDE.md#reusable_tests) and shown in the sample application.

### Usage

The base Backstopper readme covers the [usage basics](../README.md#quickstart_usage). There should be no difference when
running in a Spring Web MVC environment, but since Spring Web MVC integrates a JSR 303 validation system into its core
functionality we can get one extra nice tidbit: to have Spring Web MVC run validation on objects deserialized from
incoming user data you can simply add `@Valid` annotations on the objects you're deserializing for your controller
endpoints (`@RequestBody` object, `@ModelAttribute` objects, etc). For example:

``` java
@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.POST)
@ResponseBody
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
public SomeOutputObject postSomeInput(
        @ModelAttribute @Valid HeadersAndQueryParams headersAndQueryParams,
        @RequestBody @Valid SomeInputObject inputObject) {
    
    // ... Normal controller processing
    
}
```    

This method signature with the two `@Valid` annotations would cause both the `@ModelAttribute` `headersAndQueryParams`
and `@RequestBody` `inputObject` arguments to be run through JSR 303 validation. Any constraint violations caught at
this time will cause a Spring-specific exception to be thrown with the constraint violation details buried inside. This
`backstopper-spring-web-mvc` plugin library's error handler listeners know how to convert this to the appropriate set of
`ApiError` cases (from your `ProjectApiErrors`) automatically using
the [Backstopper JSR 303 naming convention](../USER_GUIDE.md#jsr303_conventions), which are then returned to the client
using the standard error contract.

This feature allows you to enjoy the Backstopper JSR 303 validation integration support automatically at the point where
caller-provided data is deserialized and passed to your controller endpoint without having to inject and manually call a
`ClientDataValidationService`.

## NOTE - Spring WebMVC and Servlet API dependencies required at runtime

This `backstopper-spring-web-mvc` module does not export any transitive Spring or Servlet API dependencies to prevent
runtime version conflicts with whatever Spring and Servlet environment you deploy to.

This should not affect most users since this library is likely to be used in a Spring/Servlet environment where the
required dependencies are already on the classpath at runtime, however if you receive class-not-found errors related to
Spring or Servlet API classes then you'll need to pull the necessary dependency into your project.

The dependencies you may need to pull in:

* Spring Web MVC: 
  [org.springframework:spring-webmvc:\[spring-version\]](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.springframework%20AND%20a:spring-webmvc)
* Jakarta Servlet API:
  [jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:\[servlet-api-version\]](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:jakarta.servlet%20AND%20a:jakarta.servlet-api)
