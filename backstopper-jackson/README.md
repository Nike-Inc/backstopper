# Backstopper - jackson

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 11 and greater.

(NOTE: The [Backstopper 1.x branch](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/backstopper/tree/v1.x) contains a version of
Backstopper for Java 7+, and for the `javax` ecosystem. The current Backstopper supports Java 11+ and the `jakarta`
ecosystem.)

This library contains some helper classes for working in an environment that uses Jackson with Backstopper.

## Helper classes

* **`JsonUtilWithDefaultErrorContractDTOSupport`** - A general-purpose JSON serializer that has built-in support for the
  default Backstopper error contract DTO. In particular:
    * If an error code is parseable to an integer then the JSON field for that error code will be serialized as a number
      rather than a string.
    * If an error has an empty metadata section then it will be omitted from the serialized JSON.
    * You can create a Jackson `ObjectMapper` with any combination of the above rules turned on or off by using the
      `generateErrorContractObjectMapper(...)` static factory method.
