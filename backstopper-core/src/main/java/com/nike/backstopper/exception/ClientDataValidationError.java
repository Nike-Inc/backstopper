/**
 * A runtime exception representing a <b>CLIENT DATA</b> JSR 303 validation failure (i.e. a validation error with data
 * passed to the server from the client where the client violated a contract; something that the client has control
 * over and can fix by changing what they send the server).
 *
 * <p>If a controller (or its delegate) throws one of these then it will be caught by a
 * {@link com.nike.backstopper.handler.ApiExceptionHandlerBase} via
 * {@link com.nike.backstopper.handler.listener.impl.ClientDataValidationErrorHandlerListener} and
 * turned into the appropriate set of {@link com.nike.backstopper.apierror.ApiError}s for the client, along with logging
 * as much data about this error as possible for debugging purposes.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> As mentioned previously this exception is for validation errors where the client sending the data
 * violated a contract and can fix the problem themselves. If you have a validation error with data sent between this
 * app and a downstream service where the client has no control, then you should use
 * {@link com.nike.backstopper.exception.ServersideValidationError} instead.
