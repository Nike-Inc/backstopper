# Backstopper - testonly-springboot3_3-webmvc

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 17 and greater.

(NOTE: The [Backstopper 1.x branch](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/backstopper/tree/v1.x) contains a version of
Backstopper for Java 7+, and for the `javax` ecosystem. The current Backstopper supports Java 17+ and the `jakarta`
ecosystem. The Backstopper 1.x releases also contain support for Spring 4 and 5, and Springboot 1 and 2.)

This submodule contains tests to verify that the 
[backstopper-spring-boot3-webmvc](../../backstopper-spring-boot3-webmvc) module's functionality works as expected in 
Spring Boot 3.3 Web MVC (Servlet) environments, for both classpath-scanning and direct-import Backstopper configuration 
use cases.
