# Nike Internal Util

This is a small utilities library that provides some reusable helper methods and classes. It is "internal" in the sense that it is not intended to be directly pulled in and used by non-Nike projects. That said you can use it if you want to, just be aware that some liberties might be taken regarding version numbers, backwards compatibility, etc over time when compared with libraries specifically intended for public consumption. 

## Backstopper Info

This library may move into its own repository at some point. For now it's piggybacking on the Backstopper repository. See the [base project README.md](../README.md), [User Guide](../USER_GUIDE.md), and Backstopper repository source code and javadocs for Backstopper information.
