# Backstopper - reusable-tests

**DEPRECATED - This module is based on JUnit 4, and should be considered deprecated. For the JUnit 5 version of this 
module see [here](../backstopper-reusable-tests-junit5).**

Backstopper is a framework-agnostic API error handling and (optional) model validation solution for Java 7 and greater.

This library contains some reusable unit test classes that should be integrated into every Backstopper-enabled project to guarantee that the conventions and rules that Backstopper requires are followed. This is a fairly easy process and is described in detail in the Backstopper User Guide in the [Reusable Unit Tests for Enforcing Backstopper Rules and Conventions](../USER_GUIDE.md#reusable_tests) section.

Beyond that, the classes in this reusable-tests library are heavily documented with extensive javadocs, and the [sample applications](../README.md#samples) show concrete usage of these tests to enforce the rules and conventions. Please explore the source code and samples to learn more.
